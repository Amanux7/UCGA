% ABSTRACT
% ======================

\begin{abstract}

This paper introduces Unified Cognitive Graph Architecture (UCGA), a novel graph-native cognitive framework designed to address fundamental limitations of traditional neural architectures in reasoning, memory integration, and adaptive intelligence. UCGA models intelligence as recursive interaction between cognitive nodes connected through adaptive weighted edges. We present the architecture, mathematical formulation, prototype implementation, and initial experimental validation.

We further outline a future roadmap for scaling UCGA into a full artificial general intelligence system capable of multimodal reasoning, adaptive learning, and autonomous agent operation.

% INTRODUCTION
% ======================

\section{Introduction}

Artificial intelligence systems today rely heavily on sequential neural architectures such as feedforward networks and transformer models. While these systems achieve strong performance in specific domains, they remain fundamentally limited in recursive reasoning, persistent memory integration, and adaptive cognitive restructuring.

Biological intelligence operates differently. Cognitive processes emerge from dynamic interaction between specialized regions forming a graph-like structure.

This paper introduces Unified Cognitive Graph Architecture (UCGA), which models intelligence as a dynamic cognitive graph.

% PROBLEM STATEMENT
% ======================

\section{Problem Statement}

Current architectures face several key limitations:

\begin{itemize}

\item Static architecture structure

\item Limited recursive reasoning capability

\item Weak persistent memory integration

\item Poor cross-domain adaptability

\end{itemize}

UCGA addresses these limitations by modeling intelligence as a recursive cognitive graph.

% ======================
% ARCHITECTURE
% ======================

\section{UCGA Architecture}

UCGA defines intelligence as:

\begin{equation}
G = (V, E, W, S)
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}

\item V = cognitive nodes

\item E = connections

\item W = adaptive weights

\item S = cognitive state

\end{itemize}

% RECURSIVE LOOP
% ======================

\section{Recursive Cognitive Refinement}

UCGA operates through recursive refinement cycles.

% MATHEMATICS
% ======================

\section{Mathematical Formulation}

State update equation:

\begin{equation}
v_i(t+1) =
\sigma
\left(
\sum_j W_{ij} v_j(t)
+
b_i
\right)
\end{equation}

Connection update equation:

\begin{equation}
W_{ij}(t+1) =
W_{ij}(t)
+
\alpha \delta_{ij}(t)
\end{equation}

Convergence condition:

\begin{equation}
\| S(t+1) - S(t) \| < \epsilon
\end{equation}

% IMPLEMENTATION
% ======================

\section{Prototype Implementation}

UCGA has been implemented using PyTorch.

\begin{lstlisting}

class CognitiveNode(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(dim, dim)

    def forward(self, inputs):
        combined = sum(inputs)
        return torch.tanh(self.linear(combined))

\end{lstlisting}

% ======================
% EXPERIMENTS

\section{Experimental Validation}

Initial experiments were conducted on synthetic reasoning tasks.

Results demonstrate:

\begin{itemize}

\item Stable recursive convergence

\item Adaptive reasoning improvement

\item Memory-assisted reasoning

\end{itemize}

These results validate UCGA core principles.

% AI ASSISTANCE DISCLOSURE
% ======================

\section{AI Assistance and Development Tools}

During the development of the Unified Cognitive Graph Architecture (UCGA), modern AI-assisted research and development tools were utilized to support ideation, implementation structuring, documentation refinement, and prototype development.

Specifically, large language models including Gemini (Google) and GPT-5.2 (OpenAI) were used as cognitive assistance tools to help accelerate:

\begin{itemize}

\item Research structuring and conceptual clarification

\item Mathematical formulation refinement

\item Prototype implementation guidance

\item Documentation and technical writing support

\item Development workflow planning

\end{itemize}

These tools functioned strictly as research assistants and development aids. All architectural design decisions, conceptual framework definition, and research direction were conceived, evaluated, and directed by the author.

The Unified Cognitive Graph Architecture itself is an original architectural framework proposed and developed by the author.
