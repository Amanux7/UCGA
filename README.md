## Overview

Unified Cognitive Graph Architecture (UCGA) is a novel artificial intelligence architecture that models intelligence as a dynamic cognitive graph rather than a fixed sequence of neural network layers.

UCGA is designed as a research framework for developing adaptive intelligence systems capable of recursive reasoning, persistent memory integration, and scalable cognitive processing.

Unlike traditional neural architectures, UCGA represents intelligence as an interconnected network of cognitive nodes that continuously exchange information and refine internal states.

## Core Architecture

UCGA models intelligence as a cognitive graph:

G = (V, E, W, S, M)


Where:

- **V** — Cognitive Nodes  
- **E** — Connections between nodes  
- **W** — Adaptive weights  
- **S** — Cognitive State  
- **M** — Persistent Memory  

---

## Cognitive Nodes

UCGA includes the following cognitive components:

- Perception Node  
- Memory Node  
- Knowledge Node  
- Reasoning Node  
- Planning Node  
- Evaluation Node  
- Correction Node  
- Balancer Node  
- Output Node  

These nodes interact recursively, enabling adaptive reasoning and cognitive refinement.
