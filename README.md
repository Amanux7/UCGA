## Overview

Unified Cognitive Graph Architecture (UCGA) is a novel artificial intelligence architecture that models intelligence as a dynamic cognitive graph rather than a fixed sequence of neural network layers.

UCGA introduces a new paradigm where intelligence emerges from recursive interaction between specialized cognitive nodes such as perception, memory, reasoning, planning, and evaluation.

This repository contains the research prototype, architecture design, mathematical formulation, implementation framework, and research paper.

## Core Architecture

UCGA models intelligence as a cognitive graph:

G = (V, E, W, S, M)


Where:

- **V** — Cognitive Nodes  
- **E** — Connections between nodes  
- **W** — Adaptive learnable weights  
- **S** — Cognitive state representation  
- **M** — Persistent memory system  

Each cognitive node performs specialized cognitive functions and interacts recursively with other nodes.
